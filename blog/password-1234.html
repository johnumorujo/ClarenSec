            Doctors took an oath to keep patient information secret, yet simple
            lapses in EMR (Electronic Medical Record) use, often undermine that
            duty. Even small slip ups like; weak passwords, shared login
            credentials, or sending personally identifiable information (PII)
            like name, address, phone number, e.t.c along with medical data over
            whatsapp can link to, and expose sensitive health records. Below we
            highlight several common errors and why they endanger both patients
            and healthcare providers.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
            Weak Passwords and Credential Sharing
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Easily guessed passwords present a huge risk. Examples include:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>1234</li>
            <li>password</li>
            <li>password123</li>
            <li>123456</li>
            <li>qwerty</li>
            <li>abc123</li>
            <li>111111</li>
            <li>letmein</li>
            <li>24091997(Date Of Birth)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Such predictability makes accounts easy to breach. Some hospital
            surveys have reported that over half of users admit to sharing their
            login credentials with colleagues. Any coworker (or hacker) who
            obtains your password can see or alter all of your patients’ records
            <strong>under your name!</strong> Weak password habits leave the
            door wide open for unauthorized access and even patient data theft.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
            Leaving Sessions Open.
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            In a busy clinic, staff sometimes leave EMR terminals unlocked and
            unsupervised. If your profile stays logged in, anyone can view or
            edit charts as if they were you.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Another common mistake that has been observed in hospital
            environments is staff giving out their passwords/login details to
            others. In one survey, over 70% of medical personnel reported using
            another clinician’s password at least once. This happens frequently
            when patient notes was created by one staff, and needs to be
            edited/deleted by another staff, for one reason or the other.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            This breaks the purpose of each each user having a unique ID.
            Sharing or duplicating login credentials leads to confusion and
            mistakes, because one can no longer aucrately tell who made each
            entry. As stated earlier, if someone else logs in as you and changes
            a record,
            <strong>you will be held responsible!</strong>
            Misentries or malicious edits under your account could trigger

            Inappropriate Use of Messaging and Social Media
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Ideally, Patient details should never travel via casual social media
            apps, Yet many clinicians use WhatsApp, Facebook groups, or Snapchat
            to discuss sensitive patient cases. In our local setting where the
            use of social media seems unavoidable, it should be scraped of
            sensitive/personally identifiable information like full
            names(initials can be used instead), hospital number, addresses,
            e.t.c.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            These consumer apps are not designed for healthcare usage. Accounts
            could be hacked, leaking sensitive health information of patients,
            which could be used for targetted exploitation; in cases of
            sensitive medical diagnoses, or blackmail. Any photo about a patient
            shared via WhatsApp invites serious privacy breaches and potential
            lawsuits.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
            Patient Data on Personal Devices
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Clinicians often use smartphones or tablets on the job, but
            forgetting to delete patient data from these devices is dangerous.
            One study found 88% of doctors in a recent survey, admitted keeping
            clinical information on their phones, such as ward round
            documentation, photos, videos, patient IDs, and test results.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            If that phone is lost, stolen, or hacked, months of sensitive
            records could be compromised(when faces or PII are included in these
            snaps). Sensitive health data e.g HIV status, mental health notes,
            or abuse history, if exposed, could lead to shame, discrimination,
            or blackmail.

            Impact on Healthcare Providers
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            These mistakes don’t only hurt patients, as they could endanger
            clinicians’ careers. If a hacker or coworker uses your account to
            enter false data, your user ID will be in the audit trail, making
            you the presumed author. Hospitals have fired staff in incidents
            like this. You could be framed! someone could enter false or harmful
            data under your name, resulting in legal and professional
            consequences.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Impact on Patients</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            For patients, the consequences are profound. Leaked medical records
            betray trust, and can expose sensitive information. Misused data can
            lead to identity theft, blackmail, or even physical harm.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Altered records can lead to deadly mistakes. For example, an allergy
            omitted by an impostor might cause a harmful prescription. Breaches
            erode public trust in the healthcare system; patients may begin
            withholding vital information or avoiding basic care, out of fear
            for their privacy.
          </p>

            Conclusion: Uphold Your Duty to Protect Data
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            These risks are not acceptable. As doctors and nurses, we took an
            oath to guard patient secrets, and good digital habits are an
            extension of that promise.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Use strong, unique passwords and change them regularly</li>
            <li>Never share login information</li>
            <li>
              Always log out, or lock your workstation when stepping away.
            </li>
            <li>
              Communicate patient data only via official, encrypted platforms
            </li>
            <li>
              Delete patient files from personal devices when no longer needed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mb-4">
            A few minutes of caution can prevent significant damage. Treat
            patient data like it’s as fragile as life itself. By learning good
            cybersecurity habits, clinicians can protect patient confidences,
            and their own professional reputations.
